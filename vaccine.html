		<div>The federal government says the largest mass immunization effort in Canadian history could begin as early as next week. Here's how provinces are preparing.
</div>
		<div>BRITISH COLUMBIA</div>
		<div>The provincial health officer says British Columbia is expected to receive its first doses of the vaccine next week, adding that she hopes Health Canada will soon approve its use. The first doses will go to health-care workers and elders living in long-term care, Dr. Bonnie Henry says. Provincial officials are expected to provide more information about the rollout of the vaccine in the coming days.</div>
		<div>The Canadian Press</div>
		<div>Premier Jason Kenney says Alberta expects to start getting COVID-19 vaccines in the first week of January. High-risk patients and health workers will get them first. Kenney says the vaccines will be rolled out from 30 locations in the province. Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, has said the province is expected to receive 680,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine early in the new year.</div>
		<div>ALBERTA</div>
		<div>Premier Scott Moe says Saskatchewan is ready to receive doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, with the province set to reveal its distribution plan on Dec. 8. Moe says the province has an ultra-low-temperature freezer to store the product. Vaccinations will happen in a staggered approach, with the plan being to inoculate health-care workers and vulnerable residents, such as seniors living in long-term care homes.</div>
		<div>SASKATCHEWAN</div>
		<div>Government officials say they’ve been assembling the necessary people and equipment to set up a large-scale “super site” to deliver the vaccine as soon as it is available. Premier Brian Pallister says the province is prepared to administer two doses of the vaccine to every person in the province. The first freezer able to store the Pfizer vaccine at low temperatures has been delivered and installed, with another four on the way.</div>
		<div>MANITOBA</div>
		<div>Premier Doug Ford says vulnerable seniors, their caregivers and health-care workers will be among the first to receive a vaccine. Adults in Indigenous communities, residents of retirement homes and recipients of chronic home health care will also be considered priority groups. But it may be April before the shots are widely available to others.</div>
		<div>ONTARIO</div>
		<div>Quebec says the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine could be administered in the province as early as next week. Health Minister Christian Dube says the province plans to give its first doses of the Pfizer vaccine to about 2,000 people in long-term care homes. In a technical briefing, public health experts said residents of long-term care homes and health-care workers would have first priority to receive the vaccine.</div>
		<div>QUEBEC</div>
		<div>Chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang expressed hopes an initial supply will trickle into Nova Scotia early in the new year. Strang says the plan will include tight control of the supply and clear rules dictating who can be first in line for immunization. He says he’s waiting for more federal guidance on issues ranging from priority groups to transportation and storage logistics.</div>
		<div>NOVA SCOTIA</div>
		<div>NEWFOUNDLAND/LABRADOR</div>
		<div>Premier Andrew Furey says he anticipates receiving 1,950 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine at the St. John’s receiving site next week. The announcement comes as Furey told reporters Monday that the province would remain outside of the Atlantic “bubble,” meaning all visitors to the province must self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether they come from Atlantic Canada.</div>
		<div>YUKON</div>
		<div>Premier Sandy Silver says the territory has been in discussions with various levels of government on a vaccine rollout plan. He says the goal will be to provide vaccines to elderly people and health-care providers. Silver says rural and remote communities should also get priority status. The Pfizer vaccine could cause logistical problems for remote communities because of its cold-storage requirements.</div>
